## About Me

I'm a back-end developer with 3+ years of experience developing APIs and backend services. I enjoy complex problems and turning them into clean, scalable solutions, whether I'm working solo or collaborating with a team. I care about the user experience behind the API and try to design with empathy and long-term value in mind.

I'm always learning and experimenting with new tools—especially AI, which I'm genuinely excited about and see as a big part of how we'll build software in the coming years.
